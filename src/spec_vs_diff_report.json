  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive error handling and logging improvements for profile loading operations. All three requirements appear to be addressed: REQ-1 through improved error handling and retry logic, REQ-2 through enhanced logging and error classification in frontend components, and REQ-3 through backend validation that returns null for non-existent profiles instead of throwing errors. The implementation distinguishes between authorization errors (new users), network errors, and backend errors, providing appropriate user feedback and diagnostic information.",
